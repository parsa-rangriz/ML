## Genaral information
From the first part of the project, we have the data set. In the previous milestone, we used some traditional models for training and now we want to design Neural Network for our problem . This is one of the best approaches that we can use to study the phase transition point and two magnetic phases in our Quantum Ising model.

 In this code, we try to classify the dataset into two phases.

 In this code, we try to compute the phase transition point and predict the dataset with our neural network using different approaches.
