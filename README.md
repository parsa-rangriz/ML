# Machine Learning in Physics

## Project: Phase Transition of 1D Transverse Field Ising Chain
In this project, we seek to find the phase transition point in one dimensional Transverse-field Ising model and classify different phases, using Machine Learning methods.

*Final files for the third milestone of this project is in Third Milestone folder and up to now, the other files on this repository are draft files for each milestone.
