# Machine Learning in Physics

## Project: Machine Learning for Phase Transition in Quantum Ising Model
In this project, we seek to find the phase transition point in the one-dimensional Transverse-field Ising model and classify different phases, using Machine Learning methods.

*Final files for the third milestone of this project is in the Third Milestone folder and up to now, the other files on this repository are draft files for each milestone.
