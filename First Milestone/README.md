# Machine Learning for Phase Transition in 1D Transverse Field Ising Model

### Yasamin Panahi, Asra Rezafadaei, Parsa Rangriz

## Genaral information
For the first milestone, we solved 1D Transverse-field Ising model Numerically in MATLAB using Exact Diagonalization (ED) technique, we calculated quantities such as spin - spin Correlation functions, Entanglement entropy, Expectation values of different spin operators, Energy difference and Wavefunction numbers and then we collected them as our data set.

*The last file that we uploaded here as a final one is coded by Yasamin Panahi because we needed the fastest and the most accurate code to obtain our data, but Parsa Rangriz and Asra Rezafadaei also commited to this part and each of them wrote a code for the numerical solution of Quantum Ising model.

You can find the final files here (in this folder) and the draft ones in the previous path.
