# Machine Learning for Phase Transition in 1D Transverse Field Ising model

### Yasamin Panahi, Asra Rezafadaei, Parsa Rangriz

## What members did?

Our project for this phase has some parts:

- Analytical Exact Solution - Theory: Parsa Rangriz
- Numerical Solution: Yasamin Panahi + (Asra Rezafadaei, Parsa Rangriz)*
- Searching and Reviewing Related Articles: Asra Rezafadaei
- Data Analysis: Parsa Rangriz
- Report Writing: Parsa Rangriz - Yasamin Panahi - Asra Rezafadaei

* The last file that we uploaded here as a final one is coded by Yasamin Panahi but Parsa Rangriz and Asra Rezafadaei code their own solution for data generation.
