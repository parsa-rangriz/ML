*The last file that we uploaded here as a final one is coded by Yasamin Panahi because we needed the fastest and the most accurate code to obtain our data, but Parsa Rangriz and Asra Rezafadaei also commited to this part and each of them wrote a code for the numerical solution of Quantum Ising model.

You can find the final files here (in this folder) and the draft ones in the previous path.
