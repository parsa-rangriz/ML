### Yasamin Panahi, Asra Rezafadaei, Parsa Rangriz

## Genaral information
From the first part of the project, we have the data-set and want to apply the traditional techniques (not Neural Networks) to them. This is one of the basic approaches that we can use to find the phase transition point in our Quantum Ising model.
